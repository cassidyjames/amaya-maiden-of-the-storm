# Amaya: Maiden of the Storm

Kuraokami has disappeared.

In his absence, a fierce storm has engulfed the land, imperiling all those who dare to stray outside. Only the legendary dragon can calm the savage rains, but the beacons that lead him home have fallen from their pedestals.

It falls to Amaya Shimizu, the young shrine maiden, to brave the storm, recover the scattered beacons, and guide Kuraokami home...
